            "Steps": [
                "The law of reflection states that the angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection.",
                "So, if the angle of incidence is 40 degrees, the angle of reflection is also 40 degrees."

            "Steps": [
                "Use the mirror formula: 1/f = 1/v + 1/u",
